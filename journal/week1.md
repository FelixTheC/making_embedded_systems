# Week 1 Recap
- Diagrams for embedded systems (System Architecture)

## What we've covered
- in our first week of this class we needed to learn what different kinds of diagrams exists and when they should be used
- therefore we needed to read Chapter 1 + 2 of the Making Embedded Systems and to watch the video lectures on classpert and make the tests

## What I learned
- we have several Diagrams (Block, HoC, Organizational, Layered Software)
- each of these Diagrams cover a specific view on the overall system
