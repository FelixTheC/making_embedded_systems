# Week2 recap
- Getting your Hands on the Hardware

## What we've covered
- we read the Chapter 3 of the Making embedded systems book
- this week was all about getting to know the hardware
- have a first look into the different datasheets which exists for a board
- what sections may be important to read for developers with a more software based background
- what tools exists for checking the hardware (oscilloscope, etc)

## What I learned
- datasheets for boards can be overwhelming but we don't need to read all the information at once
- graping information on the internet for a particular board can be quite time-consuming
- debugging can be made via CLI or via peripherals
